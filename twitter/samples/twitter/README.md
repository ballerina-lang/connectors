# Twitter Connector Samples

This repository consists of the samples that can be referred in using the Ballerina Twitter Connector.

# Contents:
  - samples.bal - Ballerina file with main function that utilizes all actions incorporated in the connector
  - twitter_test.bal - Testerina file for the connector
  - set_env_vars.sh - Environment variable setter
 
### Important
The test functions contain hard-coded values for the Twitter message and search query which can be changed according to your requirement before running the test file. Also, the "XXXXX" values should be replaced with the twitter ID once a tweet is posted.

These tests can be improved to use the same Twitter ID generated in the testTweet when the global variables are supported for Testarina, so that all the tests can be run from one attempt.
  
# Steps to run the test file

 1. Clone the Connector repo and download the latest Ballerina-Tools distribution
 2. Create a twitter app by visiting https://apps.twitter.com/ and obtain the following parameters:
	Consumer Key (API Key)
	Consumer Secret (API Secret)
	Access Token
	Access Token Secret
 2. Set the above twitter account details in the set_env_vars.sh.
 3. Run the set_env_vars.sh and source the file in the terminal.
 4. Navigate to $BALLERINA_TOOLS_HOME/bin
 5. Run tests in the same terminal as:
 ./ballerina test ${path_to_test_file_in_connector_repo}/amazonS3_test.bal
 6. Get the Twitter ID which will be printed on the console
 7. Replace the "XXXXX" values with the Twitter ID obtained in the test file and run the test again
